Redux is made up of 3 components: Actions, Reducers, and State

Actions: The things which we want to do. Eg., if we want to make a movie, or set a movie or want to log the user in and out the app or website, then this is known as Actions.
Reducers: These are something that takes the action and changes the state.


Actions call the Reducers and Reducers change the State

We have stored the reducer in the movieSlice.js and imported it in the app/store.js so that it can get to know that where is the reducer located
And to use this, we will do everything in the Home.js file

Home component and the Movie component share the same store which contains movies.
In the Home component, we set the new movies using the reducer and due to that, we can get the movie in side the Movie component.

In the Home component, we grab the data from the database, dispatched the action, using redux, to save the movies inside the react-store, and once we put that there, we go to the Movies component and grab it from the store.
